# Hypothesis Testing with Insurance Data
 
### Performed Hypothesis Testing on a data set to answer 3 questions. 
- These included a 2 Sample T-Test, ANOVA, and Chi-Squared.
- As with all hypothesis testing, I assessed the assumptions for each test (normality, equal variance, etc.) and chose the appropriate test.
- Visuals are provided for each test, and given both pre and post elimination of outliers.
  - Below is a visual example from our 2 Sample T-Test comparing insurance charges between Smoker and Non-Smokers, with useful statistical information
